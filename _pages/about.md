About me
----
Welcome! I am a recent graduate with a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Amsterdam. I have completed my Bachelor of Technology (B.Tech) in Electronics & Communication Engineering from NIT Trichy, one of Indiaâ€™s top 10 schools for engineering. I previously worked as a full-time intern for 13 months at Sensity AI as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern on DeepFakes Detection. Additionally, at Sensity, I have previously worked on splicing detection. In order to overcome the use of fake IDs and documents, I contributed to services provided by the company for document verification and ID verification, where I used Deep Learning to detect forgeries in IDs and documents. Through these projects, I have made myself adept in various technologies like Python, PyTorch, Docker, and many more.

Apart from the domain of Computer Vision I am also interested in the use of Machine Learning, Data Science, Deep learning and AI in general applied to the markets (hedge funds, traders, investment banks, etc.) for algorithmic trading and any element related to the analysis. I invite you to go through my resume for details about my background and experiences.
