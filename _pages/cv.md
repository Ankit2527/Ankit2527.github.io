Education
======
* MSc. in Artificial Intelligence, University of Amsterdam, (expected 2023)
* BTech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli, 2021


Work experience
======
* April 2020 - August 2020: Remote Deep Learning Research Internship at Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany

Nanoparticles occur in various environments as a consequence of man-made processes, which raises concerns about their impact on the environment and human health. To allow for proper risk assessment, a precise and statistically relevant analysis of particle characteristics (such as size, shape, and composition) is required and would greatly benefit from automated image analysis procedures. Collecting a real dataset of silicon dioxide nanoparticles is quite expensive. To overcome this issue, I worked on developing a Differentiable Trainable Renderer for Generative Adversarial Networks for the synthetic image rendering of silicon oxide nanoparticles under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Maier.
