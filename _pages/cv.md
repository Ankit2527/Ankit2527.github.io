Education
======
* MSc. in Artificial Intelligence, University of Amsterdam, 2023
* BTech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli, 2021


Work experience
======
* Machine Learning Engineer Intern: June 2022 – June 2023
  * Sensity AI, Amsterdam, Netherlands
  <!-- * Duties included: Tagging issues -->
  * Developed a Forgery Detection Network achieving 5.2% higher test accuracy than baseline for detecting counterfeit ID cards using PyTorch classification models: ResNet, MobileNetV2, SiameseNet, EfficientNet, Dual Attention Network, and Visual Transformers (ViT). As a result enhancing Sensity’s ID Verification and Document Authentication services
  * Dataset Generation using Computer Vision methodologies for augmented training of our Forgery Detection Network
  * Contributed to Sensity’s Deepfake Detection API developing a generalized deepfake detection model for detection-in-the-wild


* Remote Deep Learning Research Intern: April 2020 - August 2020
  * Pattern Recognition Lab, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany
  <!-- * Duties included: Tagging issues -->
  * Nanoparticles occur in various environments as a consequence of man-made processes, which raises concerns about their impact on the environment and human health. To allow for proper risk assessment, a precise and statistically relevant analysis of particle characteristics (such as size, shape, and composition) is required and would greatly benefit from automated image analysis procedures. Collecting a real dataset of silicon dioxide nanoparticles is quite expensive. To overcome this issue, I worked on developing a Differentiable Trainable Renderer for Generative Adversarial Networks for the synthetic image rendering of silicon oxide nanoparticles under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Maier.
  * Developed a Differentiable Trainable Renderer for Generative Adversarial Networks using PyTorch for Synthetic Image Rendering of silicon dioxide nanoparticles which effectively reduced the costs of dataset collection through TEM imaging


* Machine Learning Research Intern: May 2019 - July 2019
  * Visual Computing and Analytics Lab, Indian Institute of Technology B.H.U, Varanasi, India
  <!-- * Duties included: Merging pull requests -->
  * Developed a Feature Extraction Algorithm as inputs to classification models like SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, and XGBoost achieving 2% higher accuracy than baseline for breast cancer histopathological image classification

Projects
======
* Guiding Text-to-Image Diffusion Model Towards Grounded Generation:
  * [Report](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1MCBUU0tr1ojnIw9Q6ZzGyplvgt-d3jgx/view) of MSc AI Computer Vision-2 course project: [Repo Link](https://github.com/WalterSimoncini/grounded-diffusers)
  * Achieved 4% higher mIoU while utilizing only 25% of the total dataset generated using Stable Diffusion compared to the baseline approach for open-vocabulary segmentation
  * Investigated the impact of prompt engineering and vector maths for CLIP for image segmentation

* Google Ads Keyword Idea Generator and Scorer:
  * [Demo](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ZhSVMuftiyTd_GM70GHg2420P_bPfcKZ/view)
  * Created an LLM-powered app extracting keywords, generating new ideas through a LangChain agent, and fetching Google Ads metrics
  * Deployable via Docker, served on Chainlit, with Redis-cached metrics
