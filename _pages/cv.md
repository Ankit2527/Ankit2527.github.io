Education
======
* MSc. in Artificial Intelligence, University of Amsterdam, (expected 2023)
* BTech. in Electronics and Communication Engineering, National Institute of Technology Tiruchirappalli, 2021


Work experience
======
* Machine Learning Engineer Intern: June 2022 – Present 
  * Sensity AI, Amsterdam, Netherlands
  <!-- * Duties included: Tagging issues -->
  * Contributed to Sensity’s ID Verification and Document Authentication services
  * Implemented and trained various Deep Learning architectures in Classy Vision a PyTorch-based framework: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, SiameseNet, and Dual Attention Network
  * Scripting in Python and OpenCV for Synthetic Dataset Generation
  * Scripting dockerfile and yaml templates to create docker development containers


* Remote Deep Learning Research Intern: April 2020 - August 2020
  * Pattern Recognition Lab, Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg, Germany
  <!-- * Duties included: Tagging issues -->
  * Nanoparticles occur in various environments as a consequence of man-made processes, which raises concerns about their impact on the environment and human health. To allow for proper risk assessment, a precise and statistically relevant analysis of particle characteristics (such as size, shape, and composition) is required and would greatly benefit from automated image analysis procedures. Collecting a real dataset of silicon dioxide nanoparticles is quite expensive. To overcome this issue, I worked on developing a Differentiable Trainable Renderer for Generative Adversarial Networks for the synthetic image rendering of silicon oxide nanoparticles under the guidance of Prof. Andreas Maier.
  * Developed a Differentiable Trainable Renderer for Generative Adversarial Networks using Mitsuba2 and PyTorch
  * Optimized scene parameters with Adversarial Loss for Synthetic Image Rendering of Silicon dioxide nanoparticles


* Machine Learning Research Intern: May 2019 - July 2019
  * Visual Computing and Analytics Lab, Indian Institute of Technology B.H.U, Varanasi, India
  <!-- * Duties included: Merging pull requests -->
  * Developed an algorithm for Breast Cancer Histopathological Image Classification under the guidance of Prof S.K. Singh
  * Implemented SVM, Random Forest, Naive Bayes and XGBoost classifiers using the features extracted by the algorithm which resulted in a test accuracy of 97.91%
